"# PythonImageViewer" 
The goal of this project is to use Python and PyQt in order to create an image browser that allows you to take files on your computer and view them in a fun, simple image viewer.  I added sound features, like a looping music track in the background as well as an audio queue for moving throughout the images.  The audio queue also changes depending on what mode you are in.  The image viewer also allows you to search for images online using a Flickr API to apply a search term which will then submit a web request returning a JSON object.  That JSON object then allows you to take that data to form an HTML request and turn that into an image.  The images to view are stored locally while the online images are saved as text data for the web requests.
